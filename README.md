# Portfolio of writing samples
I am a junior technical writer that is transitioning into the field. With this portfolio, I hope to showcase and improve my writing skills. I have learnt to code using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and plan to learn Python and REACT. The tools I use to assist in writing technical samples so far are Github wiki and SnagIt for images. I follow the guidelines of the Microsoft Style guide in my samples.
